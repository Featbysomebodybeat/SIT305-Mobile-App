						<h2>Coronavirus and budget see major NT sporting events canned</h2>

					<P>Two of the Northern Territory's biggest sporting drawcards have been canned for the immediate future, with the government blaming both coronavirus and budgetary woes for the calls. </p>
					<p>The Arafura Games has in the past hosted international teams from across the Asia-Pacific region in Darwin to partake in a wide range of sports from netball to tennis and swimming. </p>
					<p>Next pegged to be held in 2021, it has been delayed until at least 2023, with the Minister responsible for its delivery Natasha Fyles saying it "represents an unacceptable level of risk of previously committed taxpayer fund". </p>
					<p>She said $1 million had already been spent on the 2021 event prior to its deferral. </p>
					<p>Head coach of the Arafura Games' women's basketball team Rod Tremlett said while it "was a bit disappointing for everyone" it wasn't a surprising move considering the global impact of coronavirus. </p>
					<p>A second major sporting event, the Alice Springs Masters Games, has been delayed from October this year until 2022. </p>
