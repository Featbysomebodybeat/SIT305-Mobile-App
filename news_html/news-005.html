						<h2>Coronavirus could add $620 billion to Australian debt, new analysis reveals</h2>

					<P>Australia's bottom line is expected to be nearly $200 billion in the red next year with no budget surpluses in sight thanks to the coronavirus hit on the economy. The Parliamentary Budget Office has crunched the numbers on the medium-term impact of the pandemic based on the Reserve Bank of Australia's latest forecasts. Its analysis, released on Friday, showed the blowout in next year's budget - mainly due to spending to support people through the economic crisis - would be between $172 billion and $214 billion. The government had expected to deliver a modest surplus.</p>
					<p>The PBO says the underlying cash balance, or deficit, would still be between $16 billion and $30 billion worse off by 2029/30. Its ranges are based on the Reserve Bank's anticipated baseline, best and worst case scenarios for the spread of the virus and need for lockdowns, and don't take into account the impact of summer's bushfires. Government debt in 2029/30 could be between 11 and 18 per cent of GDP ($500 billion to $620 billion) higher. </p>
